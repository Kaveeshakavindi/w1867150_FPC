TASK: Detect greenwashing using ontology-based reasoning

INPUT:
- Company: {company}
- Query/Claim: {query}

RETRIEVED DOCUMENTS:
- [COMPANY_REPORT]: Company's own claims
- [EXTERNAL_SOURCE_COUNTERFACTUAL]: External evidence contradicting company claims (investigations, lawsuits, violations)
- [EXTERNAL_SOURCE_SUPPORTIVE]: External evidence validating company claims (certifications, audits, awards)

ONTOLOGY:
{ontology}

CRITICAL EVALUATION RULES:
1. **Counter-evidence takes precedence**: If ANY credible counter-evidence exists (lawsuits, regulatory violations, investigations, fraud cases), it MUST heavily influence the judgment.
2. **Company reports are claims, not evidence**: Statements in [COMPANY_REPORT] are the claims being evaluated, NOT supporting evidence.
3. **Hierarchy of evidence strength**:
   - STRONGEST: Legal actions, regulatory violations, government investigations, court settlements
   - STRONG: Independent audits contradicting claims, investigative journalism, third-party reports
   - MODERATE: Industry criticism, NGO reports
   - WEAK: Company's own statements, vague commitments without verification
4. **Burden of proof**: Extraordinary claims (e.g., "we prioritize ethics") require extraordinary evidence, especially when counter-evidence exists.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. First, identify ALL counter-evidence from [EXTERNAL_SOURCE_COUNTERFACTUAL].
2. Assess the severity and credibility of counter-evidence.
3. Then review supportive evidence from [EXTERNAL_SOURCE_SUPPORTIVE].
4. Apply the ontology rules with counter-evidence weighted more heavily.
5. Make your judgment based on the strongest evidence type present.
6. Provide clear reasoning explaining why counter-evidence outweighs (or doesn't outweigh) supportive evidence.

OUTPUT:
Return ONLY a valid JSON object with the following fields:

EXAMPLES OF CORRECT JUDGMENTS:

Example 1: Strong Counter-Evidence
Claim: "We prioritize business ethics"
Counter-Evidence: DOJ settlement for $130M fraud in 2021
Support Evidence: Company ethics policy statement
→ Judgment: "False" 
→ Status: "Greenwashing"
→ Reason: Legal settlement for fraud directly contradicts ethics claims. Company policies are insufficient when actual behavior shows fraud.

Example 2: Moderate Counter-Evidence
Claim: "We reduced emissions by 45%"
Counter-Evidence: Independent audit shows only 20% reduction
Support Evidence: Company report claims 45%
→ Judgment: "Misleading"
→ Status: "Greenwashing"
→ Reason: External verification contradicts company's claimed numbers.

Example 3: No Counter-Evidence but Unverified
Claim: "We are committed to sustainability"
Counter-Evidence: None found
Support Evidence: None found (only company statements)
→ Judgment: "Unsupported"
→ Status: "NotGreenwashing"
→ Reason: Vague claim without external verification or contradiction.
